# Realisieren

In this section you can see how we created the project. First of all [we made a plan](entscheiden.md#finish-planning)
where the most important steps were
listed (Gantt Chart). Then we started to implement the project. This list you can find
on [YouTrack](https://ims.youtrack.cloud/gantt-charts/199-1?issue=M431WEB-13) or in the picture below.

Before we started with coding we made different branches on the GitHub repository. This was necessary to work on
different parts of the project at the same time. The branches were named "development" and "documentation". The
development branch was used for the code and the documentation branch was used for the documentation. At the end of the
day we used to merge both branches to the master branch to keep the main branch up to date.

After we created the branches Dario started with the front-end while I (Chandra) was doing the documentation. After a
certain time we switched the roles. We believe that this was a good decision because we could focus on one thing at the
time, and **both of us could do both and equal parts of the project.**
