# Kontrollieren und Auswerten

In this section, each member of the project team will reflect on the project. We will answer the following questions:

- How did I proceed and why did I proceed as I did?
    - What did I do well, what didn't work so well?
        - What were the causes?
- What difficulties / problems occurred?
    - What were the causes?
- What conclusions do I draw from this and what have I learned?
    - What would I do differently next time?

start with the coding.
