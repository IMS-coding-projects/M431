# Kontrollieren und Auswerten

In this section, each member of the project team will reflect on the project. We will answer the following questions:

- How did I proceed and why did I proceed as I did?
    - What did I do well, what didn't work so well?
        - What were the causes?
- What difficulties / problems occurred?
    - What were the causes?
- What conclusions do I draw from this and what have I learned?
    - What would I do differently next time?

## How did I proceed and why did I proceed as I did?

### Chandra {id="chandra-proceed"}

In the beginning I was searching for a Project Idea. Funnily enough I had learned of [invidious](https://invidious.io/)
and thought that it would be a good idea to create something similar. I asked Dario what he thought about it and he
agreed. We started to plan the project and created a Gantt Chart. After that we started to implement the project.
I think I proceeded as I did because it seemed the logical thing to do. I wanted to create something that I would use
myself and that could be useful for others (in theorie of course, since it is only the front-end, which we have
implemented).

## What did I do well, what didn't work so well and why?

### Chandra {id="chandra-well"}

I think that I mastered the JS quite well, since it was the first time I had used it. What also had worked quite well
was of course HTML and CSS. It was not the first time I had used it, but I think that I had improved my skills (
especially in linking the HTML to JS).
However like every project there were some things that did not work so well. Ironically, it was the first time I had
used JavaScript, so it was a bit tricky. I had to learn a lot of new things and I had to get used to the syntax. I am
quite grateful that we had learned C# before, because it helped me to grasp the syntax of JavaScript. When I look back
to the project I cannot say that something was dramatically difficult. It really was the JS part that was challenging.
In the end I think the project was quite successful.

## What difficulties / problems occurred and why?

### Chandra {id="chandra-difficulties"}

The biggest problem was the JavaScript. I had never used it before and I had to learn it from scratch. I had to learn
the syntax and how to use it. Also challenging was to use Git (GitHub) to be able to work with Dario. I had never worked
with another person using Git before. It was a bit tricky in the beginning, but after a while we got used to it.

## What conclusions do I draw from this and what have I learned?

### Chandra {id="chandra-conclusions"}

I think that I have learned a lot from this project. I have learned how to use JavaScript and how to use Git in a team.
What I value very much and I also think I have learned is how to create a successful project, and actually using the
IPERKA strategy. I think that I have learned a lot from this project, and I am quite happy with the result.

## What would I do differently next time?

### Chandra {id="chandra-different"}

I think it would be nice to have a bit more time to work on such projects, since they can be quite time-consuming. I
would also like to work with Dario again, since it was quite fun and easy to work with him. What I would do differently
next time is to only use JetBrains integrated development environments when using Git, since personally I find them way
more intuitive then VSC for example. What is also a big plus, is that they have smart merging capabilities, resulting in
easier pulls and commits. Example:
When pulling changes from SourceTree, and it recognizes that a local **file** is in a conflict, it immidiatly shows an
error message and drops the pull.
However when using any JetBrains client it goes to check if uncommited **lines** are in conflict and otherwise it pulls
the new code.
