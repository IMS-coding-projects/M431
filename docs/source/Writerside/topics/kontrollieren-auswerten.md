# Kontrollieren und Auswerten

In this section, each member of the project team will reflect on the project. We will answer the following questions:

- How did I proceed and why did I proceed as I did?
  - What did I do well, what didn't work so well and why?
- What difficulties / problems occurred and why?
- What conclusions do I draw from this and what have I learned?
    - What would I do differently next time?

## How did I proceed and why did I proceed as I did?

### Chandra {id="chandra-proceed"}

In the beginning I was searching for a Project Idea. Funnily enough I had learned of [invidious](https://invidious.io/)
and thought that it would be a good idea to create something similar. I asked Dario what he thought about it and he
agreed. We started to plan the project and created a Gantt Chart. After that we started to implement the project. I
think I proceeded as I did because it seemed the logical thing to do. I wanted to create something that I would use
myself and that could be useful for others (in theorie of course, since it is only the front-end, which we have
implemented).

### Dario {id="dario-proceed"}

At first, I informed myself upon several possible project ideas and which I could imagine creating in form of a project in a team. I proceeded by telling my other member of the project my possible ideas, what I found or any other significant information. Upon deciding what project should be made I started with the front-end of the website since it was probably what I could have done best. I proceeded doing things this way, think of ideas, think of what must be changed to implement my idea and if it is even possible to fulfil my goal. I used this method to work because it just flawlessly worked for me, it is logical and made me able to work efficiently and productively.

## What did I do well, what didn't work so well and why?

### Chandra {id="chandra-well"}

I think that I mastered the JS quite well, since it was the first time I had used it. What also had worked quite well
was of course HTML and CSS. It was not the first time I had used it, but I think that I had improved my skills (
especially in linking the HTML to JS). However like every project there were some things that did not work so well.
Ironically, it was the first time I had used JavaScript, so it was a bit tricky. I had to learn a lot of new things and
I had to get used to the syntax. I am quite grateful that we had learned C# before, because it helped me to grasp the
syntax of JavaScript. When I look back to the project I cannot say that something was dramatically difficult. It really
was the JS part that was challenging. In the end I think the project was quite successful.

### Dario {id="dario-well"}

Personally, the design of most that I had done came out well, it looks appealing and fulfils its purpose (as front-end). Merging conflicts were a bit frustrating, CSS declarations with certain features like the breadcrumbs or any formatting declarations were slightly troubling sometimes. I wanted the design to be appealing and not make it seem like a website that was made 20 years ago. When both members of the project edit the same line in a file and one tries to commit and push after the other already had done that, it will display an error message.

## What difficulties / problems occurred and why?

### Chandra {id="chandra-difficulties"}

The biggest problem was the JavaScript. I had never used it before and I had to learn it from scratch. I had to learn
the syntax and how to use it. Also challenging was to use Git (GitHub) to be able to work with Dario. I had never worked
with another person using Git before. It was a bit tricky in the beginning, but after a while we got used to it.

### Dario {id="dario-difficulties"}

Sometimes source tree decided to display me some error messages that ended up being solved quite easily. The most things that slightly did not work well were CSS changes/design flaws. Such as the breadcrumb not formatting in a row because I forgot a certain CSS declaration. The Problems were only that I forgot to pull in the repository, making me unable to sometimes merge or commit changes. On the other hand, for CSS declarations were mostly simple thinking problems that lead to some certain errors.

## What conclusions do I draw from this and what have I learned?

### Chandra {id="chandra-conclusions"}

I think that I have learned a lot from this project. I have learned how to use JavaScript and how to use Git in a team.
What I value very much and I also think I have learned is how to create a successful project, and actually using the
IPERKA strategy. I think that I have learned a lot from this project, and I am quite happy with the result.

### Dario {id="dario-conclusions"}

I should sometimes not think too hard about simple problems that can be easily solved with some slight changes or simple solutions (CSS as an example), there is no need to make things harder or more complicated.

## What would I do differently next time?

### Chandra {id="chandra-different"}

I think it would be nice to have a bit more time to work on such projects, since they can be quite time-consuming. I
would also like to work with Dario again, since it was quite fun and easy to work with him. What I would do differently
next time is to only use JetBrains integrated development environments when using Git, since personally I find them way
more intuitive than VSC for example. What also is a big plus, is that they have smart merging capabilities, resulting in
easier pulls and commits. Example: When pulling changes from SourceTree, and it recognizes that a local **file** is in a
conflict, it immediately shows an error message and drops the pull. However, when using any JetBrains client it goes to
check if uncommited **lines** are in conflict, and otherwise it pulls the new code.

### Dario {id="dario-different"}

Working on this project worked well and I have learned some new things along the way when working on StreamSphere.
I liked to work with Chandra on this project since it worked smoothly, and we mostly always understood what each otherâ€™s
ideas were. It should also be taken into notice that I should use JetBrains programs/tools for this kind of project
since they provide more easy and efficient working.
Overall, the process of working on StreamSphere was not troubled with grave conflicts and went rather smoothly. It would result in finishing with the project faster or being able to implement more features.

## General Reflection

We both think that StreamSphere has been a successful project, we have learnt some more new things about html, css and even javascript. We quickly got ahead with each phase of IPERKA, wasted practically no time and personally think we fulfilled each and every requirement for the Project. Overall, it was a fun project in which we worked together well and if we had to do it again we would do it the same way that we did for this Project.
