# Planen

In this section, we will document our planning for the project. Since the IPERKA strategy says that one should plan at
least 2 different variants for a project and then choose one of them. So that is what we did. Below you can see two
different variations of the project. After [choosing a Model](entscheiden.md#finish-planning) we created a gantt chart
that fit the Model.

## Variants

### Variant 1

![Variant 1](variant1.drawio.png) {border-effect="rounded" thumbnail="true"}

Here you can see the first variant of the project plan. This variant includes the following objects:
- A Header/Navbar where the logo, a search bar and a sign-in button are located.
- A Sidebar where the user can navigate through other features. (can be opened by clicking on the menu button.)
- A Main Content area where the user can see several videos.
- In the footer you can find a page switcher (and contact information.)

#### Pros: {id="pros_variant1"}
- The user can easily navigate through the website.
- The user can easily find the content he is looking for.
- The website is easy to use.

#### Cons: {id="cons_variant1"}
- none found

### Variant 2

![variant2.drawio.png](variant2.drawio.png) {border-effect="rounded" thumbnail="true"}

Here you can see the second variant of the project plan. This variant includes the following objects:
- A Header where the logo and a (smaller) search bar are located.
- A static Sidebar
- A Main Content area where the user can see several videos.

#### Pros: {id="pros_variant2"}
- The user can easily navigate through the website.
- The user can easily find the content he is looking for.
- The website is easy to use.

#### Cons: {id="cons_variant2"}
- The sidebar is static and can't be hidden.
- The search bar is smaller and might be harder to find.
- A footer and a page switcher are missing.
- It is not a modern design.
