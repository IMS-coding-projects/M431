# Informieren (inform)

The first step we took to go at this project was to inform ourselves about the topic. We did this by analyzing the requirements of the project and by researching the topic. 


## Research
Upon searching for inspiration on the internet (various websites), we found a few interesting project ideas. The most interesting and the most doable project was to create an alternative front-end for YouTube. 

Below you can find a mindmap of the project idea/personal requirements:
